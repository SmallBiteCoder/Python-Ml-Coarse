Name: Build SAM: Segment Anything Model Replication
project_discretion: Replicate the Segment Anything Model (SAM) which segments objects from prompts. Implement promptable segmentation with mask transformers and vision encoders. Train or fine-tune on segmentation datasets and evaluate model generalizability. Deep dive into prompt engineering for segmentation.
Project requirements: {'language': 'Python', 'libraries': ['PyTorch', 'OpenCV', 'Transformers'], 'concepts': ['Promptable Segmentation', 'Mask Transformers', 'Vision Encoders'], 'learn topics from': ['https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02643', 'SAM official github']}
