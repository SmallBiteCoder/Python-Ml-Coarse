Name: NumPy Array Operations
category: Core Python Libraries
project_discretion: Use NumPy to perform operations like element-wise addition, dot product, and matrix transpose on two arrays (e.g., [[1, 2], [3, 4]] and [[5, 6], [7, 8]]). This introduces NumPy, a core library for numerical computations in ML. You'll learn array creation, broadcasting, and vectorized operations, which are faster than Python loops. For example, element-wise addition yields [[6, 8], [10, 12]].
Project requirements: {'language': 'Python', 'libraries': ['numpy'], 'concepts': ['NumPy arrays', 'Broadcasting', 'Vectorized operations'], 'learn topics from': ['https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/quickstart.html', 'https://realpython.com/numpy-tutorial/']}
