Name: TD3 for Continuous Control
category: Reinforcement Learning
project_discretion: Use Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3) for a continuous control task (e.g., HalfCheetah) with Stable Baselines3. This teaches improved deterministic policy gradients.
Project requirements: {'language': 'Python', 'libraries': ['stable-baselines3', 'gym'], 'concepts': ['TD3', 'Continuous control', 'Policy gradients'], 'learn topics from': ['https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/modules/td3.html', 'https://gym.openai.com/envs/HalfCheetah-v2/']}
Time: 90
Difficulty: 85
