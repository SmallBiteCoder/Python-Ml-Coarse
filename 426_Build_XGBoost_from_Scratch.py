Name: Build XGBoost from Scratch
project_discretion: Implement the core gradient boosting decision tree algorithm entirely from scratch without ML libraries. Understand tree-based models, gradient boosting principles, and boosting's effect on weak learners. Experiment with custom loss functions, regularization, and early stopping. This tests your grasp of ensemble learning and algorithm optimization.
Project requirements: {'language': 'Python', 'libraries': ['numpy', 'pandas'], 'concepts': ['Gradient Boosting', 'Decision Trees', 'Loss Functions', 'Regularization', 'Optimization'], 'learn topics from': ['https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02754', 'https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/model.html']}
Time: 900
Difficulty: 65
