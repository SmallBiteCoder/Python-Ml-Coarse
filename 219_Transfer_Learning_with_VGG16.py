Name: Transfer Learning with VGG16
category: Deep Learning
project_discription: Use a pre-trained VGG16 model for transfer learning on a small dataset (e.g., Cats vs. Dogs from Kaggle). Fine-tune the top layers. This teaches transfer learning for image classification.
Project requirements: {'language': 'Python', 'libraries': ['tensorflow', 'pandas'], 'concepts': ['Transfer learning', 'VGG16', 'Fine-tuning'], 'learn topics from': ['https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/transfer_learning', 'https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats']}
Time: 90
Difficulty: 70
