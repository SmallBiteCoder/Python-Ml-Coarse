Project #16: Build Real-Time Object Detection Pipeline with YOLO and Edge Deployment
Category: 

Implement and train YOLO object detector on custom data. Optimize model for edge devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi) using pruning, quantization, or TensorRT. Develop a streaming pipeline that ingests video feed, performs real-time detection, and visualizes results.
