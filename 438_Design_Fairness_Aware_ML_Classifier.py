Name: Design Fairness-Aware ML Classifier
project_discretion: Develop a classifier with fairness constraints to mitigate bias across protected attributes. Implement fairness metrics (demographic parity, equal opportunity), adversarial debiasing, and bias detection. Evaluate model trade-offs between accuracy and fairness.
Project requirements: {'language': 'Python', 'libraries': ['scikit-learn', 'AIF360 (optional)'], 'concepts': ['Fairness in ML', 'Adversarial Learning', 'Bias Metrics'], 'learn topics from': ['https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09635', 'IBM AIF360 docs']}
