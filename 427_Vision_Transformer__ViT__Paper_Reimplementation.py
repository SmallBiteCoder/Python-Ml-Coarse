Name: Vision Transformer (ViT) Paper Reimplementation
project_discretion: Deeply read the ViT paper and replicate the Vision Transformer architecture from scratch using PyTorch or TensorFlow. Implement patch embedding, multi-head self-attention, and transformer encoders. Train on CIFAR-10 or ImageNet subset and analyze attention maps to understand transformer-based vision models.
Project requirements: {'language': 'Python', 'libraries': ['PyTorch', 'numpy'], 'concepts': ['Transformer Architecture', 'Self-Attention', 'Patch Embedding', 'Image Classification'], 'learn topics from': ['https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929', 'The Annotated Transformer']}
Time: 1200
Difficulty: 75
