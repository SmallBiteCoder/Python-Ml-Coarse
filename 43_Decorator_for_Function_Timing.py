Project #43: Decorator for Function Timing
Category: Python Code Efficiency, OOP, and Best Practices

Write a Python decorator to measure and log the execution time of any function. Apply it to a sample function (e.g., calculating factorials). For example, the decorator should print 'Function took 0.002 seconds'. This teaches decorators, a powerful Python feature for code reuse and performance monitoring.
