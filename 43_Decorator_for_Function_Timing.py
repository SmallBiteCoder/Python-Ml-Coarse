Name: Decorator for Function Timing
category: Python Code Efficiency, OOP, and Best Practices
project_discretion: Write a Python decorator to measure and log the execution time of any function. Apply it to a sample function (e.g., calculating factorials). For example, the decorator should print 'Function took 0.002 seconds'. This teaches decorators, a powerful Python feature for code reuse and performance monitoring.
Project requirements: {'language': 'Python', 'libraries': ['time'], 'concepts': ['Decorators', 'Function timing', 'Code reuse'], 'learn topics from': ['https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/', 'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/decorators-in-python/']}
