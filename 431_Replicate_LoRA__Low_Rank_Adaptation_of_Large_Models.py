Name: Replicate LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Models
project_discretion: Study the LoRA paper and implement the low-rank adaptation method for efficient fine-tuning of large pretrained models. Integrate into a transformer architecture and fine-tune on a downstream task with limited resources. Analyze trade-offs in parameter efficiency and performance.
Project requirements: {'language': 'Python', 'libraries': ['PyTorch', 'Transformers'], 'concepts': ['Transfer Learning', 'Low-Rank Approximation', 'Parameter Efficient Fine-tuning'], 'learn topics from': ['https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685', 'HuggingFace Transformers docs']}
