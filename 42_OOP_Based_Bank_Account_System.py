Project #42: OOP-Based Bank Account System
Category: Python Code Efficiency, OOP, and Best Practices

Design a BankAccount class with methods for deposit, withdraw, and balance check, incorporating encapsulation (private attributes) and inheritance (e.g., SavingsAccount subclass with interest). For example, depositing $100 and withdrawing $50 should update the balance correctly. This introduces object-oriented programming (OOP) principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, essential for modular ML code.
