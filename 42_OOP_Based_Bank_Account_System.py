Name: OOP-Based Bank Account System
category: Python Code Efficiency, OOP, and Best Practices
project_discretion: Design a BankAccount class with methods for deposit, withdraw, and balance check, incorporating encapsulation (private attributes) and inheritance (e.g., SavingsAccount subclass with interest). For example, depositing $100 and withdrawing $50 should update the balance correctly. This introduces object-oriented programming (OOP) principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, essential for modular ML code.
Project requirements: {'language': 'Python', 'libraries': [], 'concepts': ['OOP', 'Encapsulation', 'Inheritance', 'Polymorphism'], 'learn topics from': ['https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/', 'https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html']}
