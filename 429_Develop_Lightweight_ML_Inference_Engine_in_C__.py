Name: Develop Lightweight ML Inference Engine in C++
project_discretion: Create a neural network inference engine in C++ focusing on matrix ops, memory management, and efficiency. Support feed-forward networks with ReLU and softmax activations. Benchmark against Python libraries to understand system-level performance tradeoffs.
Project requirements: {'language': 'C++', 'libraries': ['Eigen (optional)'], 'concepts': ['Neural Network Inference', 'Matrix Multiplication', 'Memory Management', 'Optimization'], 'learn topics from': ['https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/', 'https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08688']}
