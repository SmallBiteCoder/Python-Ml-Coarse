Project #45: Type Hints for a Data Processing Function
Category: Python Code Efficiency, OOP, and Best Practices

Add type hints to a function that processes a list of numbers (e.g., calculating mean and standard deviation). Use mypy to check for type errors. For example, annotate inputs as List[float] and return as Tuple[float, float]. This teaches type hinting, a best practice for maintainable ML code.
