Project #4: Number Guessing Game
Category: Python Programming

Create a game where the computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user guesses it. Provide hints (e.g., 'too high' or 'too low') and track the number of attempts. This introduces random number generation, loops, and user interaction. For example, if the number is 42 and the user guesses 50, output 'Too high! Try again.'
