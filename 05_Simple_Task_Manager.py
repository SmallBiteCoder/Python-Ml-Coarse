Project #5: Simple Task Manager
Category: Python Programming

Build a command-line task manager that allows users to add, remove, and list tasks stored in a list. Save tasks to a file for persistence. For example, entering 'Add Buy groceries' adds the task, and 'List' shows all tasks. This teaches lists, file I/O, and basic program structure.
