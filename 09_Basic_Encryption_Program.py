Project #9: Basic Encryption Program
Category: Python Programming

Implement a Caesar cipher to encrypt and decrypt a user-input string by shifting letters (e.g., shift 'hello' by 3 to get 'khoor'). This introduces string manipulation, modular arithmetic, and functions, useful for understanding data preprocessing in ML.
