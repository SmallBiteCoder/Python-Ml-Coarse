Name: Correlation Heatmap for Housing Data
category: Data Analysis and Visualization
project_discretion: Analyze the Boston Housing dataset (from sklearn.datasets) and create a correlation heatmap using Seaborn. Identify highly correlated features (e.g., rooms vs. price). This teaches correlation analysis and visualization, critical for feature selection in ML. For example, a heatmap shows correlation coefficients between -1 and 1.
Project requirements: {'language': 'Python', 'libraries': ['pandas', 'seaborn', 'scikit-learn'], 'concepts': ['Correlation analysis', 'Heatmaps', 'Feature selection'], 'learn topics from': ['https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/heatmap_annotation.html', 'https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_boston.html']}
