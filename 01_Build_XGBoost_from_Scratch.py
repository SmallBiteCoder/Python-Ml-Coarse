Project #1: Build XGBoost from Scratch
Category: 

Implement the core gradient boosting decision tree algorithm entirely from scratch without ML libraries. Understand tree-based models, gradient boosting principles, and boosting's effect on weak learners. Experiment with custom loss functions, regularization, and early stopping. This tests your grasp of ensemble learning and algorithm optimization.
