Project #67: Correlation Heatmap for Housing Data
Category: Data Analysis and Visualization

Analyze the Boston Housing dataset (from sklearn.datasets) and create a correlation heatmap using Seaborn. Identify highly correlated features (e.g., rooms vs. price). This teaches correlation analysis and visualization, critical for feature selection in ML. For example, a heatmap shows correlation coefficients between -1 and 1.
