Project #41: Efficient Matrix Multiplication
Category: Python Code Efficiency, OOP, and Best Practices

Implement matrix multiplication using nested loops and optimize it using list comprehensions or NumPy (optional). Compare their runtimes using time.perf_counter(). For example, multiply two 3x3 matrices [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]] and [[9, 8, 7], [6, 5, 4], [3, 2, 1]]. This teaches code optimization, profiling, and understanding computational complexity (O(n^3) for naive multiplication).
