Project #2: Fibonacci Sequence Generator
Category: Python Programming

Create a function that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a user-specified number of terms. The Fibonacci sequence is a series where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones (e.g., 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8...). This introduces loops (for/while), functions, and recursion. You'll compare iterative and recursive approaches, learning about time complexity (e.g., recursive Fibonacci is O(2^n), iterative is O(n)).
