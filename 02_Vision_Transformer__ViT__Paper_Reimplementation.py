Project #2: Vision Transformer (ViT) Paper Reimplementation
Category: 

Deeply read the ViT paper and replicate the Vision Transformer architecture from scratch using PyTorch or TensorFlow. Implement patch embedding, multi-head self-attention, and transformer encoders. Train on CIFAR-10 or ImageNet subset and analyze attention maps to understand transformer-based vision models.
