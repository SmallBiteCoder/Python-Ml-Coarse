Project #46: Efficient String Search
Category: Python Code Efficiency, OOP, and Best Practices

Implement a string search algorithm (e.g., KMP algorithm) to find a substring in a text. Compare its performance with Pythonâ€™s built-in 'in' operator. For example, find 'data' in 'big data analysis'. This teaches algorithm optimization and string processing efficiency.
