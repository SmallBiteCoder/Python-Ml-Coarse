Name: Memory-Efficient Data Processing
category: Python Code Efficiency, OOP, and Best Practices
project_discretion: Process a large text file line by line (e.g., count words) using generators to minimize memory usage. For example, process a 1GB file without loading it entirely. This teaches memory-efficient programming, critical for big data in ML.
Project requirements: {'language': 'Python', 'libraries': [], 'concepts': ['Generators', 'Memory efficiency', 'File processing'], 'learn topics from': ['https://realpython.com/introduction-to-python-generators/', 'https://docs.python.org/3/howto/functional.html#generators']}
