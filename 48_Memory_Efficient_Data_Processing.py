Project #48: Memory-Efficient Data Processing
Category: Python Code Efficiency, OOP, and Best Practices

Process a large text file line by line (e.g., count words) using generators to minimize memory usage. For example, process a 1GB file without loading it entirely. This teaches memory-efficient programming, critical for big data in ML.
