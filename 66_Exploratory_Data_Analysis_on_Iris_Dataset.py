Project #66: Exploratory Data Analysis on Iris Dataset
Category: Data Analysis and Visualization

Perform EDA on the Iris dataset (available via sklearn.datasets). Compute summary statistics (mean, median, std) and visualize feature distributions using histograms and scatter plots (e.g., petal length vs. petal width). This introduces data exploration and visualization, key for understanding datasets before modeling. You'll learn about data distributions and correlations.
