Name: K-Nearest Neighbors on Wine Dataset
category: Classical Machine Learning
project_discretion: Apply KNN to classify wine quality (from sklearn.datasets). Tune the number of neighbors (k) and evaluate with cross-validation. This teaches instance-based learning and hyperparameter tuning.
Project requirements: {'language': 'Python', 'libraries': ['scikit-learn', 'pandas'], 'concepts': ['KNN', 'Hyperparameter tuning', 'Cross-validation'], 'learn topics from': ['https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html', 'https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_wine.html']}
Time: 75
