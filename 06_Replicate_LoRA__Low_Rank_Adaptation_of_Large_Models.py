Project #6: Replicate LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Models
Category: 

Study the LoRA paper and implement the low-rank adaptation method for efficient fine-tuning of large pretrained models. Integrate into a transformer architecture and fine-tune on a downstream task with limited resources. Analyze trade-offs in parameter efficiency and performance.
