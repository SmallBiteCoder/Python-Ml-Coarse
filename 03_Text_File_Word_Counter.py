Project #3: Text File Word Counter
Category: Python Programming

Write a program that reads a text file and counts the frequency of each word, ignoring case and punctuation. For example, for a file containing 'Hello world! Hello.', the output should be {'hello': 2, 'world': 1}. This introduces file I/O, string manipulation, and dictionaries. You'll learn about data structures (dictionaries), file handling, and basic text processing, foundational for NLP tasks.
