Name: Text File Word Counter
category: Python Programming
project_discretion: Write a program that reads a text file and counts the frequency of each word, ignoring case and punctuation. For example, for a file containing 'Hello world! Hello.', the output should be {'hello': 2, 'world': 1}. This introduces file I/O, string manipulation, and dictionaries. You'll learn about data structures (dictionaries), file handling, and basic text processing, foundational for NLP tasks.
Project requirements: {'language': 'Python', 'libraries': [], 'concepts': ['File I/O', 'Dictionaries', 'String manipulation'], 'learn topics from': ['https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files', 'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-dictionary/']}
