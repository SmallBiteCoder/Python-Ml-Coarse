Name: Simple To-Do List with Priority
category: Python Programming
project_discretion: Extend the task manager to include task priorities (e.g., High, Medium, Low). Allow sorting tasks by priority. For example, 'Add Buy groceries High' adds a high-priority task. This introduces sorting algorithms and more complex data structures like lists of tuples.
Project requirements: {'language': 'Python', 'libraries': [], 'concepts': ['Lists', 'Sorting', 'Data structures'], 'learn topics from': ['https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html', 'https://realpython.com/python-data-structures/']}
